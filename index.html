    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class="text">The ruling Awami League (AL) has consolidated political power through sustained harassment of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and those perceived to be allied with it, as well as of critical media and voices in civil society. Corruption is endemic, and anticorruption efforts have been weakened by politicized enforcement. Due process guarantees are poorly upheld and security forces violate human rights with near impunity. Violence and discrimination against religious minorities and refugees, particularly Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, are significant problems.</p>
    <h2>Key Developments in 2023</h2>
    <div class="next">
        <ul>
            <li>Ahead of parliamentary elections planned for January 2024, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) along with dozens of other parties declared a boycott of the polls, choosing instead to wage a campaign of strikes and blockades to disrupt the election. In response, the government arrested thousands of BNP members and supporters.</li>
            <li>In September, the government sentenced two leaders of the human rights watchdog Odhikar to prison for allegedly spreading false information. Other international and domestic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported increased legal and bureaucratic obstructions as the parliamentary elections approached.</li>
            <li>In September, the government replaced the controversial Digital Security Act with the Cyber Security Act, but many critics remained concerned that the new law would be used to stifle online speech in the same ways the old law had been used.</li>
